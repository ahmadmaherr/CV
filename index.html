  <h3>Education</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bachelor Degree of Engineering, (Electrical Communication
      and Electronics Systems Department) at MSA university
      (2014-2019).</li>
    <li>Bachelor Degree of Engineering, <a href="https://www.gre.ac.uk/">University of Greenwich</a>

  <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
  <p>Designed a developed model of an automatic greenhouse
    as a graduation project, a system that is powered by a
    renewable clean energy source as it uses solar panels that
    converts solar energy into electrical energy, The systems
    measures and controls 6 different parameters
    (Temperature - Humidity - Water Level - TDS - Moisture -
    pH level), the system consists of 3 different stages
    connected to each other, the first stage is sensors stage
    that sends accurate readings to the second stage which is
    the microcontroller. microcontroller starts to analyze these
    readings in order to determine the right action to take to
    send signals to third stage, which is the actuators stage
    that works on equalizing these conditions. this system is
    fully automatic which led to decrease human interference
    which led to decrease errors.
